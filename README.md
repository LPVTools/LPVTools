LPVTools
Summary: LPVTools is a MATLAB toolbox for modeling and design in the Linear Parameter-Varying framework (LPV). LPVTools contains data structures and tools that allow users to model parameter dependent systems in MATLAB and Simulink. In addition, the toolbox contains a collection of functions for model reduction, analysis, synthesis and simulation in the LPV framework.

Developers: G. Balas, A. Hjartarson, A. Packard, and P. Seiler.

Toolbox: LPVTools Version 1.00 (April 23, 2015): LPVToolsV1.00.
To install LPVTools, download and unzip the most recent version linked above. Change the Matlab directory to the unzipped folder and run the function ‚Äúaddlpv.m‚Äù. This will add the required paths to your Matlab installation. A full manual including examples is integrated into the standard Matlab documentation. To access this manual type ‚Äúdoc‚Äù at the Matlab prompt and then select ‚Äúsupplemental software‚Äù. A PDF copy of this manual is linked in the reference list below.

System Requirements: MATLAB R2014b or later plus Control System Toolbox and Robust Control Toolbox.

Funding: LPVTools was developed by Musyn, Inc. with funding support from a NASA Small Business Innovation Research contract from NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (Contract #NNX12CA14C. Contract Monitor: Dr. Martin J. Brenner).
